"How do I pick which currency I want to be paid out in?":
    | 
    <p>Your desired payout currency is automatically determined by the type of
    address you're mining with. So if you mine with a Bitcoin address as your
    username, then by default everything you mine will exchanged to Bitcoin and
    paid out to that address. This can be done since most (almost all) altcoins
    have a unique address "prefix", which is technically known as the address
    version. For instance, a Vertcoin address will always start with a "V", 
    while most Bitcoin addresses start with a "1".</p>

    <br><p>However, some of the coins versions overlap - such as Urocoin and
    ULTC, Viacoin and Vertcoin, etc. This means our system can't <i>always</i>
    automatically determine which you intended. In the future we'll be adding a
    method to explicitly specify which you want, but for now when there is a
    conflict we have picked one for the default. So for example: if you mine
    with a ULTC address all of your earnings will actually be converted to
    Urocoin. If this isn't what you intended, its not a complete loss, your
    ULTC address is actually also a valid URO address.

"What if I want to keep X currency, and not have it Auto-Exchanged?":

    Your user settings page allows you to specify a payout address for any
    currency that you <i>don't</i> want to exchange to the currency of your
    mining addresses. Also note that some currencies <b>cannot</b> be exchanged
    for your mining currency and to recieve these currencies you <b>must</b>
    specify a payout address. These currencies are separated out on your
    settings page under "Unexchangeable Currencies".

"I have a payout marked 'payout pending' that hasn't been paid out in days. Whats the deal?":
    |
    <p>Some currencies have payout minimums. For example, Syscoin requires that a
    transaction output be no smaller than .05, which means we are completely
    unable to payout a balance smaller than that.</p>

    <br><p>The only other currencies (at the moment) which have minimums are
    BTC (0.0001 minimum), and LTC (0.001 minimum). At some point we'll get
    these all listed out somewhere so it is easier to navigate.</p>

    <br><p>Once your balance exceeds the minimum you'll get paid out normally.</p>
